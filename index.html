       <p style="font-size:25px;">The <a href=https://europarl.europa.eu/portal/en>European Parliament</a> is the directly elected parliamentary 
        institution of the European Union.
        Together with the Council of the European Union 
        and the European Commission<!--links to European Union & and Commission-->,
        it exercises the legislative function of the EU. The Parliament is composed 
        of 751 members,
        who represent the second-largest democratic electorate in the world (after the Parliament of India) 
        and the largest trans-national democratic electorate in the world (375 million eligible voters in 2009).

      <h1 style="font-size:50px;"><br><font color="#c4c4ff">European Council</font></h1>
       <p style="font-size:25px;">The European Council, charged with defining the European Union's overall political direction and priorities,
        is the institution of the EU that comprises the heads of state or government of the member states,
        along with the President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission.
        The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy also takes part in its meetings.
        Established as an informal summit in 1975, the European Council was formalised as an institution in 2009
        upon the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. Its current President is Donald Tusk.</p>

      <h1 style="font-size:50px;"><br><font color="#c4c4ff">Council of the European Union</font></h1>
      <p style="font-size:25px;">The Council of the European Union (often still referred to as the Council of Ministers, 
        or sometimes just called the Council is the third of the seven institutions of the European Union
        as listed in the Treaty on European Union. It is part of the essentially bicameral EU legislature 
        (the other legislative body being the European Parliament)
        and represents the executive governments of the EU's member states. 
        It is based in the Europa building in Brussels.
        The Council meets in 10 different configurations of 28 national ministers (one per state).
        The precise membership of these configurations varies according to the topic under consideration; for 
        example, when discussing agricultural policy the Council is formed by the 28 national ministers whose 
        portfolio includes this policy area (with the related European Commissioners contributing but not voting).
        The Presidency of the Council rotates every six months among the governments of EU member states, 
        with the relevant ministers of the respective country holding the Presidency at any given time ensuring 
        the smooth running of the meetings and setting the daily agenda.[4] The continuity between presidencies
        #is provided by an arrangement under which three successive presidencies, known as Presidency trios, 
        share common political programmes. The Foreign Affairs Council (national foreign ministers) is however 
        chaired by the Union's High Representative.
